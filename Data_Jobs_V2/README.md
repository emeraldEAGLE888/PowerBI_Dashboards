## Introduction
While the first data jobs dashboard provides an overarching view of the job market, this dashboard was created to assist **job seekers** in providing specific, detailed information about requirements to enter the data sphere. This dashboard utilizes a *real-world* dataset of data science job postings from 2024 (which includes titles, salaries, skills, and more) to provide an easy-to-use tool which streamlines the job search into a single-page interface, displaying insights about compensation and skills needed.
