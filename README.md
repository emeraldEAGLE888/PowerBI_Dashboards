# Power BI Data Jobs Dashboard Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of dashboards that I created to assist **job seekers** in providing accurate, detailed information about the current data job market. These dashboards utilize a *real-world* dataset of data science job postings in 2024 (including titles, salaries, locations, and more) to provide an easy-to-use tool to explore market trends and compensation in the world of data jobs.

# Featured Dashboards
The dashboards below explore different aspects of the data job market using different visualizations. Each has its own README with details about the build process and included features.

## About This Portfolio
The dashboards included within this portfolio have their own `README.md` file (located in their respective folders) to offer deeper insights into the project's objectives and skills used. 

Both dashboards included were completed in conjuction with [Luke Barousse's Power BI for Data Analytics](https://www.lukebarousse.com/powerbi) course. I highly recommend checking out his courses!
