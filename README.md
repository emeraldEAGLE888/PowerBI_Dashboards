# Power BI Data Jobs Dashboards

This repository contains a collection of dashboards that I created to assist **job seekers** in providing accurate, detailed information about the current data job market. These dashboards utilize a *real-world* dataset of data science job postings in 2024 (including titles, salaries, locations, and more) to provide an easy-to-use tool to explore market trends and compensation in the world of data jobs.

This project was completed in conjuction with [Luke Barousse's Power BI for Data Analytics](https://www.lukebarousse.com/powerbi) course.
